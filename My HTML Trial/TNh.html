            <strong>A</strong> fading neon gleam casts shadows over stone<br>
            The city's shining skin is shedding from the bone
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I</strong>'ve gone from pillar to pariah in the slide<br>
            In seas of doubt I swim against the turning tide
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>B</strong>roken bodies line the walls<br>
            Midas empires crash and fall<br>
            Wings that melt when we try to soar<br>
            Close my eyes as I descend<br>
            To the gold rush at it's end<br>
            Take me back to before...
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>T</strong>his isn't human anymore<br>
            Look into the natural heart<br>
            Following the beat of the chemical<br>
            This isn't human anymore<br>
            Tearing the connections apart<br>
            Crawling at the feet of our pedestals<br>
            Are you still human at the core?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>P</strong>ushing the reflex<br>
            Pressure the defects<br>
            Breaking down is inevitable<br>
            Spraining the rivets<br>
            Straining the limits<br>
            Breaking down is inevitable
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>T</strong>he ghosts of order dot the eye and the tilt the three<br>
            I stalk the trinity into conspiracy
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>T</strong>hey painted masterworks and set them all alight<br>
            The scars of persecution always harden into spite
        </p>
        <p>
